# Acceptable usage

## Your local policy

We recommend you write an acceptable usage policy to let users know how to behave on your network.

Explaining and implementing the consequences, which may include banning users from your local network, is up to you.

## Removing users from GovWifi

We will not necessarily remove users from the entire GovWifi service if they breach your acceptable usage policy.

We will remove users for breaching our [terms of service](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terms-and-conditions-for-connecting-to-govwifi/terms-and-conditions-for-connecting-to-govwifi). This includes, but is not limited to, illegal activity and breaching the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code).

**Reporting abuse**

If a user is breaching the terms repeatedly or sufficiently severely, we will remove them from the service.

If you believe a user is breaching our terms of service, [please contact us via the support page] (https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help).
