# Acceptable usage

## Your local policy

We recommend you write a policy to let users know how to behave on your network ('acceptable usage policy').

Explaining and implementing the consequences - which may include banning users from your local network - is up to you.

## Removing users from the GovWifi service

### GovWifi Terms of Service

We will not necessarily remove users from the entire GovWifi service if they breach your acceptable usage policy.

We will remove users for breaching our [terms of service](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terms-and-conditions-for-connecting-to-govwifi/terms-and-conditions-for-connecting-to-govwifi) - which includes, but is not limited to, illegal activity and breaching the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code).

### Reporting abuse

If you believe a user is breaching our terms of service, please contact us at govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.

If a user is breaching the terms repeatedly or sufficiently severely, we will remove them from the service.
