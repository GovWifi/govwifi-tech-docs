## GovWifi Terms and Conditions for Organisations

GovWifi lets public sector workers work in other departments’ and agencies’ buildings without the need to register for the local guest wifi service. It has been designed so that it can replace existing guest wifi services if required. Organisations wanting to use GovWifi for other purposes should contact GDS for advice.

## GDPR (General Data Protection Requirements)
GDPR is covered in our Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). To confirm your organisation’s acceptance of these data protection requirements you will need to download and sign the MoU.
