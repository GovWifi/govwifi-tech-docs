# Manage GovWifi

## Withdraw legacy services

After you’ve successfully deployed GovWifi, consider removing less secure guest wifi services.

## Site configuration information

You can view and update your GovWifi configuration in the [GovWifi admin platform](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/)

## Log traffic, detect malware and block users

GovWifi provides a set of private credentials to a user which is used to generate a unique encryption key. This protects the user’s privacy and device.

Traffic monitoring and logging is performed by the organisation providing the wireless access points or gateway. You must ensure that traffic logging and monitoring complies with your organisation’s internal legal and operational guidance.

In the event of a serious incident, you can request logs for specific users and, if necessary, deny service to them by blocking their hardware address on your infrastructure. [Contact us](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help) for help.
