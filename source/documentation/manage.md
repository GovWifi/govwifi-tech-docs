# Managing GovWifi

This guidance explains how you can manage GovWifi for your organisation once it's been installed.


## Withdraw legacy services

After you’ve successfully deployed GovWifi, consider removing less secure guest wifi services.


## View and update your site configuration

You can view and update your GovWifi configuration in your [GovWifi admin account](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/)


## Manage acceptable use

You are responsible for setting your own acceptable use policy and configuring content filtering and firewall controls.


## Remove users from GovWifi if necessary

If you find someone breaching your acceptable use policy, you can remove their access from your local network.

We will remove users for breaching GovWifi’s [terms of service](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terms-and-conditions-for-connecting-to-govwifi/terms-and-conditions-for-connecting-to-govwifi). This includes, but is not limited to, illegal activity and breaching the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code).


### Report abuse

If you believe a user is breaching the GovWifi terms of service, [contact us](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help).


## Log traffic

You’re responsible for traffic monitoring and logging. You must make sure traffic logging and monitoring complies with your organisation’s internal legal and operational guidance.

In the event of a serious incident, you can request logs for specific users. If necessary you can deny service to them by blocking their hardware address on your infrastructure. [Contact us](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help) for help.


## Stop using GovWifi

If your organisation wants to stop using GovWifi, [contact us](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help).
