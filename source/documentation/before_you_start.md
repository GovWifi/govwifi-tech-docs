## Privacy notice

Administrators and end users should read the GovWifi [privacy notice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govwifi-privacy-notice) before using the service.

**Who we are**

GovWifi is a secure wifi service. It provides wifi access in government buildings. GovWifi is developed and provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), which is part of the Cabinet Office.

GovWifi is currently in public beta, which means we’re still testing and improving it.

The data controller for GDS is the Cabinet Office. They determine how and why personal data is processed. [Read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053) for more information.

**What data we need**

In order that GovWifi can work effectively for you we need the following data:

- email address OR mobile telephone number
- the number of authentication attempts you make
- activation and login dates

We also identify the buildings in which you access GovWifi.

The legal reason we process this data is to let users in government, arm’s length bodies and public sector organisations stay connected to a secure wifi service while visiting other departments and moving between buildings.

**Why we need it**

We need to know when you last used GovWifi so we can delete your account if it has not been used for 12 months.

We need to know your email address or mobile phone number so that we can notify you about major changes to the service or changes to the terms and conditions. For example, if the current inactive account deletion period of 12 months is reduced.

In accepting the terms and conditions of use you agree to the acceptable use policy of your host organisation. That organisation may restrict access for lawful purposes. We are obliged to be able to identify users who do not comply with these terms and conditions so access can be restricted/terminated.

**What we do with it**

GDS will share this information with any host organisation from which you access the service if they request it.

GDS may occasionally contact you by email or text message, using the information you’ve provided, to give you important information about the GovWifi service, including:

- major changes to GovWifi, like restricting access to non-public sector workers
- changes to these terms and conditions
- requests for feedback to improve GovWifi

**We will not**

- sell or rent your data to third parties
- share your data with third parties for marketing purposes

We will share your data if we are required to by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

**How long we keep your data**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as:

- the law requires us to
- we need to provide this service to you

We will keep your contact details for as long as you are using GovWifi. After one year’s inactivity these will be deleted. We will keep your usage details (number of times you have accessed GovWifi and locations) for 90 days.

**Children’s privacy protection**

Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.

**Where it might go**

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.

GDS will not process your personal data, or transfer it, outside of the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA).

**How we protect your data and keep it secure**

We are committed to keeping your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. We also make sure that third parties we deal with have an obligation to keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.

**What are your rights**

You have the right to request:

- information about how your personal data is processed
- a copy of any personal data you have provided in an accessible format
- that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately
- to raise an objection about how your personal data is processed
- that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it
- that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances

If you have any of these requests, get in contact with our Data Protection Officer. Contact details can be found below.

**Changes to this notice**

We may modify or amend this privacy notice at our discretion at any time. When we make changes to this notice, we will amend the last modified date at the top of this page. Any modification or amendment to this privacy notice will be applied to you and your data as of that revision date. If these changes affect how your personal data is processed, GDS will take reasonable steps to make sure you know.

**How to contact us**

The data controller for your personal data is the Cabinet Office.
