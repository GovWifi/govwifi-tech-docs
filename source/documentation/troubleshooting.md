# Support

We support GovWifi administrators on problems with the central authentication service.

Your organisation is responsible for helping your users connect to GovWifi. This is because you can check for problems with their devices and your local network.

## If an individual user is having trouble connecting

You should:

- direct them to [our guidance on common issues](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/support/)
- search [the logs](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/logs/search/new/username) to confirm they are reaching our service
- check our [status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk) to see if there are any problems with the GovWifi service

## If your entire organisation is having trouble connecting

You should:

- check your [IPs and RADIUS secret keys](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/ips) match your local configuration
- search [the logs](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/logs/search/new/location) to confirm traffic from your organisation is reaching our service
- check our [status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk) to see if there are any problems with the GovWifi service

[Contact us](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help) if you have a problem that you cannot fix locally.
