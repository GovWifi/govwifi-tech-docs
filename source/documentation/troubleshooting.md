## For users

### Network problems

If your device can connect to public wifi networks like coffee shop wifi, you should be able to connect to GovWifi.

If you cannot see the GovWifi network in your wifi settings, you might be in a building that does not have GovWifi. Look for GovWifi posters or contact the local IT team to check.

You might be using a managed device if you can:

- connect other devices to GovWifi but you cannot see the network on a specific device
- see the GovWifi network but your device tells you that you do not have permission to connect

If you think you are using a managed device, contact your local IT team. They’ll tell you if:

- they can install a profile for GovWifi so that you can connect
- you’re using a secure government device that’s not allowed to connect to GovWifi
