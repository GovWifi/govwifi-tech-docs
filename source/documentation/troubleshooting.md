# Support

You must provide technical support to users of devices you manage, even if they are in a different building. You should provide a ‘best effort’ support service for unmanaged devices trying to connect to your wifi infrastructure.

GDS does not support end users of GovWifi, but will support you once you have completed all diagnostic tests, if you find a problem with the central authentication service.

More support information can be found in the admin platform. If you can’t resolve the issue locally, [contact us](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help).
