# Troubleshooting

## For support desks

Members of the support and help desk will potentially get support queries from employees or guests that struggle to get access to the GovWifi network.

We plan to provide downloadable troubleshooting guidelines for dealing and resolving those issues, but in the meantime, refer to this documentation.

If you can't resolve the issue locally, [please contact us via the support page] (https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help).

## For network administrators

If your GovWifi network does not respond, please consider the following steps:

- Do you use the right IP address in our systems?
- can check that in your Admin Platform
- Did you enter the secret correctly?
- You can check that in your Admin Platform
- Look at the logs of your Device AP
- Use a known login
- Check the server status

## For users

### Network problems

If your device can connect to public wifi networks like coffee shop wifi, you should be able to connect to GovWifi.

If you cannot see the GovWifi network in your wifi settings, you might be in a building that does not have GovWifi. Look for GovWifi posters or contact the local IT team to check.

You might be using a managed device if you can:

- connect other devices to GovWifi but you cannot see the network on a specific device
- see the GovWifi network but your device tells you that you do not have permission to connect

If you think you are using a managed device, contact your local IT team. They’ll tell you if:

- they can install a profile for GovWifi so that you can connect
- you’re using a secure government device that’s not allowed to connect to GovWifi

## Device-specific connection instructions
