# Get support

For support, contact us via our [support form](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/help). 

We’re here Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm. We’ll reply within 1 working day. 

If you've already set up GovWifi, we recommend you follow these steps to try and resolve issues locally first. 

## If your entire organisation is having problems

If your entire organisation is having trouble connecting to GovWifi:

- [check your IP addresses and RADIUS secret keys](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/ips) match your local configuration
- [search the logs](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/logs/search/new/location) to confirm traffic from your organisation is reaching our service
- [check our status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk) to see if there are any problems with the GovWifi service

## If an individual user is having problems

If an individual user is having trouble connecting to GovWifi:

- [direct them to our guidance on common issues](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/connect-to-govwifi/get-help-connecting/)
- [search the logs](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/logs/search/new/username) to confirm they are reaching our service
- [check the status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk) to see if there are any problems with the GovWifi service

If they’re using a device issued by another organisation, tell them to contact the organisation for help. There may be an issue with their permissions.
