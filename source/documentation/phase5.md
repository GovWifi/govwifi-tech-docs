# Phase 5: Maintain GovWifi

## Viewing logs

Planned features for the [GovWifi admin platform](https://admin-platform.wifi.service.gov.uk/users/sign_up) will display your organisation's usage of GovWifi.

In the meantime, if you need logs/information to diagnose a problem, contact us at [govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

**Site configuration information**

You can view and update your GovWifi configuration in the [GovWifi admin platform](https://admin-platform.wifi.service.gov.uk/)

**Log traffic, detect malware and block users**

GovWifi provides a set of private credentials to a user which is used to generate a unique encryption key. This protects the user’s privacy and prevents their device from attack.

Traffic monitoring and logging is performed by the organisation providing the wireless access points or gateway. You must ensure that traffic logging and monitoring complies with your organisation’s internal legal and operational guidance.

You can [request logs for specific users](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/set-up-govwifi-on-your-infrastructure#logs) and, if necessary, deny service to them by blocking their hardware address on your infrastructure. In the event of a serious issue contact GovWifi support for assistance.
