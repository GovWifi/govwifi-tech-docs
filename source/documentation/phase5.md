You’ll receive an encrypted PDF file which contains the report you requested. The password to decrypt this file will be sent to your phone in a text message.

### Site configuration information

Send an email to newsite@wifi.service.gov.uk with the name of the site in the subject field. You’ll receive the current RADIUS secret and authorised IP addresses for that site.

### Log traffic, detect malware and block users

GovWifi provides a set of private credentials to a user which is used to generate a unique encryption key. This protects the user’s privacy and prevents their device from attack.

Traffic monitoring and logging is performed by the organisation providing the wireless access points or gateway. You must ensure that traffic logging and monitoring complies with your organisation’s internal legal and operational guidance.

You can [request logs for specific users](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/set-up-govwifi-on-your-infrastructure#logs) and, if necessary, deny service to them by blocking their hardware address on your infrastructure. In the event of a serious issue contact GovWifi support for assistance.
