# Phase 4: Go live

## When to go live

You should make sure that you have tested GovWifi before rolling it out to the organisation. Consider these steps:

- Track performance of the testing
- Ask users about their experience of signing up and using GovWifi
- Ask users that have been already signed up before to see if the device will connect automatically
- See how security technology (VPN, locked down computers) are corresponding with the network
- Brief your support desk team and download the troubleshooting guideline for the help desk
