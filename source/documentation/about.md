# About GovWifi

## Use

GovWifi is an authentication service running in the cloud that makes all the various participating wifi networks appear as one. Participating organisations configure their wifi infrastructure to access the GovWifi authentication service using the RADIUS open standard.

Each end user is protected with unique credentials and encryption keys when they log in to the wifi and access the internet. These credentials are randomly generated so cannot be used to get into other systems if stolen.

Once logged in, users can access their organisation’s resources in the same way they would if they were working away from the office. Depending on an organisation’s requirements, users may need to use a virtual private network (VPN). Users’ devices are isolated from each other to stop the horizontal spread of malware and protect secure devices from less secure ones.

The network also identifies itself in a way that cannot be spoofed, adding to the safety measures that provide protection from potential attackers.

## Benefits

GovWifi is a single wifi login which can be simply and cheaply installed by government departments over their existing infrastructure.

Anyone who registers with GovWifi will have access to wifi at any participating public sector location. It’s available to civil servants, consultants and visitors to government departments. Users register once. After that, they’ll automatically connect to the GovWifi network.

## Adoption rate

GovWifi currently has over 160,000 registered users, and around 50,000 unique users every day.
