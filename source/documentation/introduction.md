# Offer GovWifi

Public sector staff and their guests often have to remember different usernames and passwords for wifi networks in multiple organisations and buildings.

GovWifi solves this problem. Public sector staff sign up once and connect their device using their unique details. They’ll then automatically connect to GovWifi in any building that offers it.

If you’re trying to connect a device to GovWifi, read our [sign up instructions](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/about-govwifi/connect-to-govwifi/).
