# About GovWifi

Public sector staff and their guests often have to remember different usernames and passwords for wifi networks in multiple organisations and buildings.

GovWifi solves this problem. Public sector staff and guests sign up once and connect their device using their unique details. They’ll then automatically connect to GovWifi in any building that offers it.

If you manage IT services in a public sector organisation and would like to make GovWifi available in your buildings, this technical documentation explains how to:

- set up GovWifi
- manage the GovWifi connection
- manage acceptable use of GovWifi

## How GovWifi works

To offer GovWifi in your organisation, you configure your existing wifi infrastructure to access the GovWifi authentication service.

GovWifi uses Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol to authenticate users’ usernames and passwords.

Each end user sends a text or email to request their unique username and password. They use those credentials to connect to the wifi and access the internet.

A user’s credentials:

- are randomly generated for each user
- must not be shared with other users
- can be used to connect to GovWifi on all their corporate and personal devices

## Who it’s for

Organisations can offer GovWifi in their buildings if they are fully controlled or funded by the UK government. This includes:

- central government departments
- local government
- emergency services
- NHS trusts
- UK embassies and consulates

Anyone can connect a device to GovWifi once they have signed up for a username and password. This includes:

- public sector workers
- consultants and contractors
- members of the public who need to work from buildings - like lawyers and jurors in courts, or private sector workers collaborating with government
