# Offer GovWifi

Public sector staff and their guests often have to remember usernames and passwords for multiple wifi networks across different organisations and different office locations.

GovWifi solves this problem by letting public sector staff sign up once and then use the same details to automatically connect in any building that offers GovWifi.

> If you’re trying to connect a device to GovWifi, read our [sign up instructions](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/about-govwifi/connect-to-govwifi/).

## How GovWifi works

GovWifi uses RADIUS server technology to authenticate users’ usernames and passwords.
Each end user is protected with unique credentials and encryption keys when they log in to the wifi and access the internet. These credentials are randomly generated so can’t be used to get into other systems if stolen.

Users’ devices are isolated from each other to stop the horizontal spread of malware and protect secure devices from less secure ones. The network also identifies itself in a way that can’t be spoofed, adding to the safety measures that provide protection from potential attackers.

If you manage IT services in a public sector organisation and would like to make GovWifi available in your buildings, use this technical documentation to find out how to:

+ set up GovWifi for your public sector organisation
+ manage the GovWifi connection in your buildings
+ manage your users and acceptable use of GovWifi

The Government Digital Service operates the GovWifi service and supports public sector network administrators to set up and manage GovWifi in their organisations.
