# Phase 3: Test

Most organisations test a product they want to scale. For GovWifi, we recommend a test phase, which you start by signing up for GovWifi. This had following benefits for you:

## Steps of testing GovWifi

- Sign up for GovWifi by following step 1 of Create a new wifi installation
- Sign the MoU
- Sign up your administrators
- Add the details of one or two buildings where youâ€™d like to test GovWifi, instructions are here (linking to adding buildings)
- Install your access points
- Check to see if the IP is active
- Identify a number of users who will test GovWifi, and collect feedback about the service
- Make sure there is a local help desk that can deal with incoming support queries
- At the end of the trial collect statistics and performance results
- Present these results to the senior management team and get approval to rollout GovWifi across the organisation
- Go live

## Guidance during the test phase

**Who to involve**

Choose a department with 30 to 50 employees that regularly hosts visitors. Make sure you run the trial on a day when internet traffic is not expected to be too high, as the test may cause service disruption.

**Prepare for the test**

Tell your employees about the GovWifi test and provide instructions how to use it during the test.

**What to test**
- Network performance: Should be at 80% minimum.
- Sign in flow: Should be at 90 % minimum
- Problems: Should be at 5% maximum

**How long to test**

For guest wifi you can do tests for one day. To get the best results, you should do at least 5 tests, over a  2 week period.

**How to measure**

Track the performance on your dashboard. It will give you an indication of how the network is performing. You should also enter manual support requests into the dashboard, so this can be included in the final result of the testing.

**What to do next**
When the trial is completed, you will receive suggestions how to proceed. Depending on your test results, this might be one of the following:

- All good - you can scale up and go live
- Make adjustments, run another test
- We detected performance issues - what can wedo to fix them?
