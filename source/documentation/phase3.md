# Phase 3: Test

Most organisations test a product they want to scale. For GovWifi, we recommend a test phase, changing some subset of your infrastructure to test authenticating users.

## Steps of testing GovWifi

- Sign up for a GovWifi by following step 1 of Create a new wifi installation
- Sign the MoU (contact us at [govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](govwifi-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for a copy of this document)
- Add the public IP addresses of your authenticators, using the [GovWifi admin platform](https://admin-platform.wifi.service.gov.uk/), so that they can connect to GovWifi
- Configure your authenticator(s) (e.g. access points) to use the GovWifi RADIUS servers
- Identify a number of users who will test GovWifi, and collect feedback about the service
- Make sure there is a local help desk that can deal with incoming support queries
- At the end of the trial collect statistics and performance results
- Present these results to the senior management team and get approval to rollout GovWifi across the organisation
- Go live

## Guidance during the test phase

**Who to involve**

Choose a department with 30 to 50 employees that regularly hosts visitors. Make sure you run the trial on a day when internet traffic is not expected to be too high, as the test may cause service disruption.

**Prepare for the test**

Tell your employees about the GovWifi test and provide instructions how to use it during the test.

**What to test**
- Network performance: Should be at 80% minimum.
- Sign in flow: Should be at 90 % minimum
- Problems: Should be at 5% maximum

**How long to test**

For guest wifi you can do tests for one day. To get the best results, you should do at least 5 tests, over a 2 week period.
